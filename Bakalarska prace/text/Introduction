Visual Analysis of Plans for Multi-Agent Path Finding with Continuous Time
--------------------------------------------------

Data-driven decision making
With growing amount of data and information-driven processes, visual analysis is relevant.
One of the data consuming task is Multi-Agent planning. Solution could include redundencies,
therefore visual analysis is needed.

In modern technological and economical environment the importance of data has increased dramatically. As a matter of fact, data-driven desicion making has a lead role in succesfull management techniques. Nevertheless, in order to extract genuine value from your data, the one must process data correctly. Dealing with vast amount of data has a potential to increase probability of making a miscalculation in data processing. In such situation we could implement tools that facilitate visual analysis of data, i.e. use visual interfaces to process data.

Among various algorithmic problems there is a certain class of problems, that requires proper visual analysis in order to be solved correctly, - those are problems on graphs. Graph is an abstraction, that models interconnections between set of objects. It is a collection of vertices and edges, that are defined by pairs of vertices. One of the most common type of problems that are solved on graphs is space-orientated problems, where vertex is an abstraction for a location(cities,rooms, airports) and an edge is an abstraction for a route between them. The problem is commonly stated, that we need to find the shortest path from a location A to a location B. Let's make an assumption that there is only one agent, that travels on graph. In this case, in order to succesfully find a path we need to take into account only restrictions that are put by space-graph. However, if we add more agents, that are travelling on graph, we should take other agents movements as a restrictions that must be considered while finding the solution. This kind of problems is called Multi-Agent Path Finding problem. Multi-Agent Pathfinding(MAPF) problem deals with finding paths for multiple agents, so they can avoid collisions with each other and reach their target destination.
The solution to MAPF problem is as complex as amount of agents involved, which leads to the necessity of using visual analysis of the solution. Thus, there is a motivation to design a visualiation tool. Visualization of MAPF problem is crucial for further analysis of the solution, finding its redundancies and detecting ways to make it more effective.
   
The main goal of this thesis is to design and develop a visualization tool for multi-agent pathfinding problem with continuous time that enables its visual analysis. In interest of achieving this goal, following tasks must be accomplished:
- Study relevant literature on MAPF-R and identify aspects deserving visualization
- Design and implement visualization tool of MAPF-R plans
- Provide documentation of both the user part and the program so that future upgrades are possible
- Analyze economic potential of the visualization tool in logistic domains where MAPF-R is used as an underlying concept for navigating robotic manipulators

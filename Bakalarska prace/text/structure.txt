- Study relevant literature on MAPF-R and identify aspects deserving visualization
- Design visualization of MAPF-R plans and implement it as part of user-friendly software
- The software should be cross-platform and should use modular architecture
- Provide documentation of both the user part and the program so that future upgrades are possible
- Test the visualization with existing MAPF-R planner
